#.Net Core Zoom App Integration
This is a web application that is used to integrate a simple .Net Core Web-Api project to Zoom Application. The main used entities are User and Meeting. 
To call the api requests you will need a token, given by Zoom Application when creating a JWT App (https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/using-zoom-apis)
The project is based on 3-tier architechture and repository pattern.
